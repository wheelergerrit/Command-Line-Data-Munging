# Command-Line-Data-Munging
This was a repo created to explore data munging using only the 
command line to create python scripts.

Now that you have the csv file saved, go back and change your python
fuctions to handle this specific dataset.

Some future questions to consider on dataset:
What headline length leads to the most upvotes?

What submission time leads to the most upvotes?

How are the total numbers of upvotes changing over time?
